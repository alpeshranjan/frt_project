<h2> Proposed Methodology </h2>
<p> Using the dataset from Kaggle for historic prices of top 100 cryptocurrency coins for exploratory data analysis using tools provided by MicrosoL azure. Later on using Power BI for visualisation of the desired results. We are using Power BI because the solu6on comprises several products and services, and value and versatility comes from leveraging the individual elements, and taking advantage of how they work together. Hence making the predictive conclusion will be easier and
accurate as user point of view. </p>
